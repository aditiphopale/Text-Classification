# Text-Classification
Developed a model that learns to identify if the context in an email is Spam or Ham

The dataset was selected from Kaggle. It consists of two columns: Category and Message. Message column consists of one or more sentences of varying length and about various topics. They are a combination of spam advertising, lottery and fraud messages along with normal messages between two people. The Category column is the response variable which categorizes the messages into two parts: Spam or Ham.

The analysis has been done using Python 3.7. 
Used 3 models to learn how to identify the spam texts, which are: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
